**Ð¡onvSegNet** is an utility, based on tiny-dnn and Opencv, for training a CNN that should be used for convolutional segmentation of the images.
Convolutional segmentation here means that network view slides across input image with fixed window and at each step
makes a classification decision and writes output value (if other not mentioned the probability of object) in output image.
