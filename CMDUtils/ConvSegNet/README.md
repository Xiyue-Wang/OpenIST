**cnnconvsegnet** is an utility, based on tiny-dnn, for training a CNN that
should be used for convolutional segmentation* of the image

*it means that network slides across input image with fixed window and at each step
makes a classification decision and writes output value (if other not mentioned the probability of object) in output image
